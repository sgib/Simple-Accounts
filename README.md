# Simple-Accounts
Overview

‘Simple Accounts’ is an iPad only App written in Swift and using Core-Data.  It was conceived as an opportunity to demonstrate my programming abilities by ‘copying’ an existing App from the App Store.  I chose to base my App on the ‘Spending Tracker’ App by MH Riley Ltd.  My App is strictly for noncommercial/educational usage and so I hope it doesn't break any kind of copyright laws.
Rather I hope it shows that given a ‘brief’ (i.e. the app to copy) I was able to create a good implementation of that brief.  In particular I would like to think that my App is not only functionally correct but more importantly well written.

Features

There are some differences between the Apps; mine has only 4 tabs rather than 5 and is generally a lot simpler also.  I chose to present my reports in table-form rather than graph-form because I think a pie-chart can’t show as much data as a table.  
The settings tab isn't really needed in my App as I haven’t ‘developed’ the App enough to have many settings to set.  This again is a deliberate choice as the purpose of the App is one of demonstration not completeness, obviously any accounting-based App could be developed/improved almost indefinitely with new features.
